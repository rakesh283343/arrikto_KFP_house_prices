### Predicting House-Prices

In this repo we are converting [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ryanholbrook/feature-engineering-for-house-prices) provided for [House prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) Kaggle competition into Kubeflow pipeline. The notebook is a buildup of hands-on-exercises presented in Kaggle Learn courses of [Intermediate Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning) and [Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering)

Kubeflow pipeline has been implemented in two version:
1. "Vanilla" version
2. Kale version
